# HACKVSIT4.0 - HELPACE
HackVSIT 4.0, organized by the Association of Computer Enthusiasts, is an annual event that congregates the developers' community of students to build awesome stuff. Within a span of 24 hours, participant teams aim to build innovative and practically feasible solutions to prevalent social issues; all of that with a pinch of fun and lots of brainstorming.

## HELPACE - CARE AND HELP FOR ALL
There are over 26.8 million people with disabilities in India and the number grows every
year. It becomes really important to build an environment which provides a safe and a
free space to accommodate their needs and create a welcoming environment.

## WHAT IT DOES
As technology becomes more inclusive, our idea is to create a webApp that -
* Create a public forum for real-time feedback about places which
are inclusive or not by the visitors
* Spread awareness and help make public spaces more inclusive.

## CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO 
Working with Firebase was something new for us. We ran into inital configuration trouble but eventually found a way out and learn a new piece of tech!

## WHAT WE LEARNT
Being in our first offline hackathon, we had a great deal of learnings while having fun :P We learnt time management, dealing with new technologies to try out like Firebase and vite. We also learnt to not take up more tasks than we can, which we believe was the most important lesson as a team.

## WHATS NEXT FOR HELPACE?
Lots of things!
We have a proper path laid out make this project more accessible and inclusive towards specially abled people.
Some of our steps moving forward would be to include
 * Including the talkback feature for easy navigation on the web app.
 * Accessing live location and finding accessible places nearby
 * Manage the database for handling large number of users.
